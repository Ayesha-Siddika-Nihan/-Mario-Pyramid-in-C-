During my gap year in Bangladesh, I embarked on an educational journey that would fundamentally reshape my understanding of computer science. Armed with nothing more than a modest laptop and an unreliable internet connection, I discovered Harvard's CS50x course. This decision marked the beginning of an intensive exploration into the world of programming, algorithms, and computational thinking.

The journey began without fanfare or sophisticated equipment. There were no state-of-the-art development environments or high-speed internet connections. Instead, there was simply an unwavering curiosity and determination to understand how computers process information and execute instructions. What started as casual exploration evolved into a systematic study of computer science fundamentals, with C programming serving as the cornerstone of this educational foundation.

## Week 0: Foundations in Computational Thinking

### Scratch Programming Environment

The initial week introduced computational thinking through Scratch, a visual programming language developed by MIT. Professor David Malan's approach to teaching fundamental programming concepts through this block-based interface proved instrumental in establishing core programming logic without the complexity of syntax.

The transition from abstract thinking to concrete implementation became clear through Scratch projects. Understanding concepts such as loops, conditionals, variables, and functions through visual representation created a solid foundation for more complex programming languages that would follow.

### Interactive Game Development

One of the notable projects developed during this phase was an interactive jumping game. The game mechanics were straightforward yet educational:

**Game Features:**
- Space bar controls for character jumping
- Collision detection algorithms
- Score tracking systems
- Progressive difficulty scaling

This project demonstrated fundamental game development principles while reinforcing programming concepts learned through Scratch's visual interface. The experience highlighted how programming logic translates into interactive user experiences.

## Week 1: Introduction to C Programming

### Transition to Text-Based Programming

Week 1 represented a significant paradigm shift from visual programming to text-based coding through the C programming language. Despite having encountered C programming during my senior high school curriculum, Professor Malan's teaching methodology provided clarity and depth that made complex concepts accessible and intuitive.

The transition involved understanding fundamental aspects of C programming that extend beyond basic syntax. Memory management, pointer arithmetic, and low-level system interactions became central themes. The course emphasized not just how to write C code, but why certain approaches are more efficient or appropriate for specific computational tasks.

### Core Programming Concepts Mastered

The week covered essential programming fundamentals that serve as building blocks for more advanced topics:

**Data Types and Variables:** Understanding primitive data types, their memory allocation, and appropriate usage contexts. This included exploring the differences between integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and their respective limitations and applications.

**Control Structures:** Implementing conditional statements and iterative loops to control program flow. The emphasis was on understanding when to use different types of loops and how to construct efficient conditional logic.

**Functions and Modularity:** Creating reusable code segments through function development. This concept introduced the importance of code organization, parameter passing, and return value handling.

**Input and Output Operations:** Managing user interaction through standard input and output functions, including proper error handling and data validation techniques.

The Mario project required creating a program that generates right-aligned pyramids of specified heights using hash symbols. This seemingly simple task reinforced several important programming concepts:

The implementation required nested loop structures to manage both horizontal spacing and symbol placement. Understanding the mathematical relationships between pyramid height, spaces, and symbols was crucial for correct output formatting. The project emphasized the importance of loop control variables and their manipulation to achieve desired visual outputs.
